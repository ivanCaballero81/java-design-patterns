## Intent

The Mute Idiom is designed to simplify error handling by muting exceptions that are deemed non-critical or expected in specific contexts, especially within multithreaded or complex control flow environments.

**Programmatic Example**

Sure, here's a programmatic example of the Mute Idiom design pattern based on the code in the module:

## Explanation

The Mute Idiom is a design pattern that is used to simplify error handling by muting exceptions that are deemed non-critical or expected in specific contexts. This pattern is particularly useful in multithreaded or complex control flow environments.

## Programmatic Example

We have a `Resource` interface that has a `close` method which throws an `IOException`.

```java
public interface Resource extends AutoCloseable {
  @Override
  void close() throws IOException;
}
```

We also have an `App` class that uses this `Resource`. In the `App` class, we have a `useOfLoggedMute` method that demonstrates the use of the Mute Idiom. Here, we acquire a `Resource`, utilize it, and then attempt to close it. The closing of the resource is done in a `finally` block to ensure that it is executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.

```java
public class App {
  // ...

  private static void useOfLoggedMute() {
    Optional<Resource> resource = Optional.empty();
    try {
      resource = Optional.of(acquireResource());
      utilizeResource(resource.get());
    } finally {
      resource.ifPresent(App::closeResource);
    }
  }

  // ...
}
```

The `closeResource` method is where the Mute Idiom is applied. We use the `Mute.loggedMute` method to suppress any `IOException` that might be thrown when closing the resource. This is done because the failure to close a resource is considered a non-critical issue that does not affect the overall logic or outcome of the program.

```java
public class App {
  // ...

  private static void closeResource(Resource resource) {
    Mute.loggedMute(resource::close);
  }

  // ...
}
```

In this way, the Mute Idiom allows us to simplify error handling by reducing boilerplate code for expected exceptions, enhancing code readability and maintainability, and allowing uninterrupted execution for non-critical exceptions.

## Applicability

* Useful in scenarios where certain exceptions are predictable and do not affect the overall logic or outcome.
* Commonly used in logging, cleanup operations, or when working with APIs that signal non-critical issues via exceptions.

## Tutorials

* [JOOQ: Mute Design Pattern](http://blog.jooq.org/2016/02/18/the-mute-design-pattern/)

## Known Uses

* Muting exceptions in background tasks or threads where interruption is expected.
* Handling known issues in third-party libraries where exceptions can be safely ignored.

## Consequences

Benefits:

* Simplifies error handling by reducing boilerplate code for expected exceptions.
* Enhances code readability and maintainability.
* Allows uninterrupted execution for non-critical exceptions.

Trade-offs:

* Can lead to missed critical issues if overused or misapplied.
* Makes debugging harder if exceptions are muted indiscriminately.

## Related Patterns

* [Null Object](https://java-design-patterns.com/patterns/null-object/): Both aim to simplify error handling; Null Object avoids null checks while Mute Idiom avoids exception handling complexities.
* [Decorator](https://java-design-patterns.com/patterns/decorator/): Can be used to wrap functionality with additional error handling or muting behaviors.
